OverlayCord optimized version with DirectX and SIMD Instruction, to improve the performance. 
it is still processing the FrameBuffer via CPU so the performance isnt that good for bigger drawings. but if you use normal box, cornered box and that stuff you are good to go 

it is undetected, we are dont changing any window flags.
